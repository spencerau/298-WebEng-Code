# Project 4: Generative Art

To practice Javascript in a *fun and exciting* way, we will be using it to create Generative Art similar to the famous Joy Division album cover.

For this assignment, you will be following a [tutorial by Generative Artistry](https://generativeartistry.com/tutorials/joy-division/). 

Create an HTML file in this directory with a blank canvas element to get started, then add your javascript file with the code necessary to create the artwork. 

After completing the tutorial, you **must make at least one additional change** to the code (randomly create a color for each line, modify the CSS, etc) to make your masterpiece unique.

## Submission
Submit a zip file with all necessary files to Canvas.
