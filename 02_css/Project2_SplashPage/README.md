# Project 2: CSS Splash Page

CSS is what allows you to control the visual layout and aesthetic of your web page. There's a lot for us to dive into with CSS - layout modes, responsive design, animations, spacing, etc. But you can accomplish a lot with very little if you think creatively.

For this assignment, clone or copy/paste the `index.html` and `style.css` files in this directory to your local computer. Then create your own additional css file, and modify the html to link to it. This should be the **only** change you make to `index.html`, the rest you should change using CSS. You are welcome to explore changes to the HTML for fun, but you're only submitting your CSS file and it should work with the template HTML that is given.

Then, play around with using images, color, and typography alone to change the entire feel of a web page. We will learn more advanced layout and positioning techniques later, so for now try to stick to the following CSS attributes:

- `background`
- `background-color`
- `color`
- `font-family`
- `font-weight`
- `box-shadow`
- `font-size`
- `margin`
- `padding`
- `border`
- `border-radius`

**Images Hint:** Normally, we would set the URL for our images in the HTML as a `src` attribute on an `img` tag, but to modify the images in the css without modifying the html, you can use the following approach: 

```
.logo {
  content: url("url-for-logo");
}

.illustration {
  content: url("url-for-illustration-img");
}
```

## Submission

Submit your CSS file to Canvas (nothing else). We will play around in class switching out the CSS file for the same HTML to see many different student's attempts, so make sure your styling works on the HTML file that is given.

## Reading and Resources

If you're feeling lost, make sure you have completed the recommended readings for this week listed in the [course schedule](https://profstudebaker.notion.site/Interterm-Schedule-Intro-to-Web-Engineering-c8a0830956cb40e688eb2cd34401a3a3). They will help you complete this assignment!

Since this is a creative, design-oriented assignment I also recommend looking at my [list of design resources](https://profstudebaker.notion.site/Web-Design-Resources-d976f4446fab4289ab3440a6a28cea53) for inspiration on finding fonts, color palettes, assets, gradients, and more!
